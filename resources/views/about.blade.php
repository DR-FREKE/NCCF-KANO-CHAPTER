            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-7">In the late 1950s, there lived a British missionary, specifically a Scottish by name Pa. S. G. Elton who resided in Ilesa, Osun State (i.e South Western part of Nigeria). He gave a prophecy that a time will come when the Federal Government
                of Nigeria will pay her youths to preach the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ to the nooks and crannies of the Nation. This prophecy tarried for some time and looked like it will not come to pass until between 1967 and 1970, when Nigeria
                was hit with Civil war popularly known as Biafra war. However, in 1973, during the regime of General Yakubu Gowon, in a bid to build on United Nigeria he established a scheme known as NYSC (National Youth Service Corps), this scheme demands
                that young Nigerian graduates be posted to States other than their states of origin to serve their fatherland in other to foster unity. In 1983, NCCF (Nigerian Christian Corpers’ Fellowship) came into existence.
                <br><br>
                <div>The Nasarawa State chapter of NCCF was established in 1997 at the Government Science School Lafia, with the state secretariat in Lafia, the state capital. Presently, the fellowship is in her 17th generation. NCCF Nasarawa State chapter
                    consists of thirteen (13) Zones with numerous sub-zone and chapters.
                </div><br>
                <div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Generally, NCCF is a tripartite entity. It operates as a registered firm/organization, fellowship and family. As a registered corporate entity, her headquarter is in Jos, Plateau State. On this front, a very high level of discipline and accountability is required to ensure that the firm is adequately situated in the trend of the Nation. As a fellowship, we are non-denominational (inter-denominational) in our approach to sensitive issues that have brought segregation to the Churches in Nigeria and the World at large. To ensure orderliness, we adhere strictly to House rules and regulations with uttermost priority given by the HOLY SPIRIT without compromise of any kind. As a family, love is our language, our conduct and our way of life; we love “INSPITE OF AND NOT BECAUSE OF”. We learn to let go of our individual differences by speaking with one voice despite the tongues (languages). As a result, our weakness becomes our strength and our Unity lies in our diversity.&nbsp;</span><br></div>
